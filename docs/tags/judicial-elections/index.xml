      <description>&lt;p&gt;The ongoing debate within the academic and legal communities over the propriety of judicial elections provides an excellent opportunity to utilize empirical research to address a normative debate. One of the key concerns expressed by judicial reformists is the influence of money and campaign contributors on judges and state supreme courts, yet we know relatively little about why individuals decide to contribute to judicial candidates and how specifically this alters judicial behavior. Using an automated approach to match contributions to individual judicial decisions, I have collected data to test a theoretical model of judicial campaign contributors; do individuals spend money to influence electoral outcomes, improve the probability of success in their own litigation, obtain access to the appellate courts, or a combination of these factors? I have begun to evaluate these competing theories in a paper on judicial decisionmaking in business cases, which received the Outstanding Poster Award at the 2014 State Politics meeting. In another paper, I extend this dataset to determine to what degree appointed judges exercise independence from those responsible for their selection to office relative to elected judges. While previously scholars have assumed appointment systems lead to an insulated judiciary, I empirically evaluate this assumption in states with fixed-term appointments.&lt;/p&gt;
