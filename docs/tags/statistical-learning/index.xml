      <title>Agenda-Setting in State Supreme Courts</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Much of the research on judicial agenda-setting has focused on individual behavior within the confines of the U.S. Supreme Court. This precludes the possibility of accounting for how institutional structure shapes a court&amp;rsquo;s attention as the Court&amp;rsquo;s formal procedures have not changed significantly in the past 80 years. In my dissertation I develop a generalizable model of judicial agenda-setting which views judges and litigants as rational actors interacting within a specific institutional structure. I empirically test several hypotheses derived from this model on state supreme courts. Enabled by an NSF Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant, I utilized advanced computational processes and machine learning approaches to measure the policy attention and procedural path of 60,000+ cases heard by state supreme courts over a ten-year period, as well as discretionary cases which were rejected by a sample of states without a decision on the merits. These measures are combined with knowledge on the institutional structure of each state supreme court to evaluate several hypotheses at the macro- and micro-levels: that institutional barriers and ideological fractionalization of the court lead to fewer policy decisions; that judges engage in sincere, not sophisticated, agenda-setting; and that campaign contributions by a litigant or her attorney to a state supreme court justice increase the probability of the judge voting to grant review. To facilitate this research, I utilize several computational approaches to analyzing large datasets including machine classification and textual analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Campaign Financing in State Supreme Courts</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The ongoing debate within the academic and legal communities over the propriety of judicial elections provides an excellent opportunity to utilize empirical research to address a normative debate. One of the key concerns expressed by judicial reformists is the influence of money and campaign contributors on judges and state supreme courts, yet we know relatively little about why individuals decide to contribute to judicial candidates and how specifically this alters judicial behavior. Using an automated approach to match contributions to individual judicial decisions, I have collected data to test a theoretical model of judicial campaign contributors; do individuals spend money to influence electoral outcomes, improve the probability of success in their own litigation, obtain access to the appellate courts, or a combination of these factors? I have begun to evaluate these competing theories in a paper on judicial decisionmaking in business cases, which received the Outstanding Poster Award at the 2014 State Politics meeting. In another paper, I extend this dataset to determine to what degree appointed judges exercise independence from those responsible for their selection to office relative to elected judges. While previously scholars have assumed appointment systems lead to an insulated judiciary, I empirically evaluate this assumption in states with fixed-term appointments.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Elections, Campaign Financing, and the Criminal Justice System</title>
      <link>http://www.bensoltoff.com/test-hugo/project/judicial-elections-criminal-justice/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the United States the government strives to implement a fair and impartial justice system, yet many states hold district attorneys and trial court judges directly accountable through public elections. The usage of elections raises questions surrounding prosecutorial responsiveness to public opinion, the independence and accountability of judges, and the influence of money in determining the outcomes of elections and the decisions made by prosecutors and judges. Do elections facilitate the implementation of an impartial system of justice, or do they introduce systematic biases? This project leverages data on campaign contributions, electoral outcomes, and criminal sentencing decisions to assess how money and politics influence criminal justice in the United States. These are all questions which I seek to answer through the use of massive data.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>U.S. Supreme Court and Mandatory Jurisdiction</title>
      <link>http://www.bensoltoff.com/test-hugo/project/scotus-mandatory-jurisdiction/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Scholars have long understood that the process by which the U.S. Supreme Court sets its agenda has important implications for its ability to shape policy at the national level. Since 1925, however, nearly all of its cases have come to the Court under the same rules regarding the Court&amp;rsquo;s discretionary jurisdiction. This lack of institutional variation makes inferences about the influence of the Court&amp;rsquo;s agenda-setting process on its subsequent decisions difficult. An important exception, however, are cases arising under the Court&amp;rsquo;s mandatory jurisdiction. In a project with Christopher Zorn, we leverage more than six decades of the Court&amp;rsquo;s decisions using a matched case design to evaluate how the Court&amp;rsquo;s agenda-setting process shapes a host of Court behavior: votes on the merits, aggregate outcomes, opinion writing, and concurring and dissenting behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
