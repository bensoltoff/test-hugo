      <title>Agenda-Setting in State Supreme Courts</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Much of the research on judicial agenda-setting has focused on individual behavior within the confines of the U.S. Supreme Court. This precludes the possibility of accounting for how institutional structure shapes a court&amp;rsquo;s attention as the Court&amp;rsquo;s formal procedures have not changed significantly in the past 80 years. In my dissertation I develop a generalizable model of judicial agenda-setting which views judges and litigants as rational actors interacting within a specific institutional structure. I empirically test several hypotheses derived from this model on state supreme courts. Enabled by an NSF Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant, I utilized advanced computational processes and machine learning approaches to measure the policy attention and procedural path of 60,000+ cases heard by state supreme courts over a ten-year period, as well as discretionary cases which were rejected by a sample of states without a decision on the merits. These measures are combined with knowledge on the institutional structure of each state supreme court to evaluate several hypotheses at the macro- and micro-levels: that institutional barriers and ideological fractionalization of the court lead to fewer policy decisions; that judges engage in sincere, not sophisticated, agenda-setting; and that campaign contributions by a litigant or her attorney to a state supreme court justice increase the probability of the judge voting to grant review. To facilitate this research, I utilize several computational approaches to analyzing large datasets including machine classification and textual analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>U.S. Supreme Court and Mandatory Jurisdiction</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Scholars have long understood that the process by which the U.S. Supreme Court sets its agenda has important implications for its ability to shape policy at the national level. Since 1925, however, nearly all of its cases have come to the Court under the same rules regarding the Court&amp;rsquo;s discretionary jurisdiction. This lack of institutional variation makes inferences about the influence of the Court&amp;rsquo;s agenda-setting process on its subsequent decisions difficult. An important exception, however, are cases arising under the Court&amp;rsquo;s mandatory jurisdiction. In a project with Christopher Zorn, we leverage more than six decades of the Court&amp;rsquo;s decisions using a matched case design to evaluate how the Court&amp;rsquo;s agenda-setting process shapes a host of Court behavior: votes on the merits, aggregate outcomes, opinion writing, and concurring and dissenting behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
