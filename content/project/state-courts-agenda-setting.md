Much of the research on judicial agenda-setting has focused on individual behavior within the confines of the U.S. Supreme Court. This precludes the possibility of accounting for how institutional structure shapes a court's attention as the Court's formal procedures have not changed significantly in the past 80 years. In my dissertation I develop a generalizable model of judicial agenda-setting which views judges and litigants as rational actors interacting within a specific institutional structure. I empirically test several hypotheses derived from this model on state supreme courts. Enabled by an NSF Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant, I utilized advanced computational processes and machine learning approaches to measure the policy attention and procedural path of 60,000+ cases heard by state supreme courts over a ten-year period, as well as discretionary cases which were rejected by a sample of states without a decision on the merits. These measures are combined with knowledge on the institutional structure of each state supreme court to evaluate several hypotheses at the macro- and micro-levels: that institutional barriers and ideological fractionalization of the court lead to fewer policy decisions; that judges engage in sincere, not sophisticated, agenda-setting; and that campaign contributions by a litigant or her attorney to a state supreme court justice increase the probability of the judge voting to grant review. To facilitate this research, I utilize several computational approaches to analyzing large datasets including machine classification and textual analysis.
